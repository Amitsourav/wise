3. **Adobe Stock** - Good European business collection
4. **Unsplash** (Free) - Search: "office meeting", "business collaboration"
5. **Pexels** (Free) - "European office", "financial consulting"

### AI Image Generation Prompts
If using Midjourney, DALL-E, or similar:

```
"Professional photograph of European financial advisors meeting in a modern Milan office, 
natural window lighting, minimalist interior, collaborative discussion at elegant table, 
business casual attire, no one looking at camera, muted navy and grey color palette, 
Italian corporate style, cinematic quality, shot on Hasselblad --ar 12:5 --v 6"
```

### Custom Photography Guidelines
If hiring a photographer:
- Location: Modern corporate office with European aesthetic
- Time: Golden hour or soft morning light
- Styling: Italian business fashion (tailored, not flashy)

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Save image as:** `hero-financial-team.jpg`
2. **Place in:** `/images/` folder
3. **Update HTML:**
```html
<div class="hero-image">
    <img src="images/hero-financial-team.jpg" 
         alt="Wise Bridge Global Partners team collaborating in modern European office" 
         style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
</div>
```

## Alternative Hero Concepts

## Color Grading Reference
Apply these adjustments to any image:
- Reduce saturation: -15%
- Increase contrast: +10%
- Cool temperature slightly
